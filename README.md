Greetings, I'm a Brazilian full-stack developer 

Passionate about technology and creating new things from the ground up using different types of programming languages, in my last year of studies towards a bachelor's in Information Technology.

"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe... Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion... I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh√§user Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain..."
